# Twitter-Overlap

  This code will:

      *) Get the follower ids of twitterNameOne

      *) Save then to ids.dat

      *) Get the follower ids of twitterNameTwo

      *) Compare them against ids.dat

      *) Write the double-followers to overlap.dat

  It is not robust against errors, etc.
  
  It needs TwitCurl.
